# GVMP Hotreload

## Out-dated
Since GVMP switched to rage:MP 1.1, everything works properly again. 
So: no use for the tool.

## Usage
Get your Launcher config and change the "config.json" with values from "C:\Program Files (x86)\GVMP-Launcher\GVMP-Launcher.exe.Config"

### Reconnecting after Server-Restart
If server restarts, just whitelist your self again, start the tool and use F1 -> Reconnect to reconnect.

### Reconnect while Ingame
If you want to reconnect while you're ingame, use F1 -> Reconnect & then start the tool.
